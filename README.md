# HoneyBee :honeybee:
> A Functional Unit for processors that executes edge collision detection for motion planning algorithms

The Honey Bee has long been renowned for its tireless work ethic. However, only recently have we given the Honey Bee credit for its remarkable navigation and collision avoidance strategies during flight. As such, it is quite appropriate that I name this functional unit, designed to work tirelessly and rapidly to execute collision detection computations, the HoneyBee.
